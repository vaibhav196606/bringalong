## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, go to your project and add these variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://bringalong-cluster:Hukam%401005@cluster0.ijrikm4.mongodb.net/traveler-connect?retryWrites=true&w=majority

JWT_SECRET=bringalong-production-super-secret-jwt-key-2025-change-this-to-something-random
