# BringAlong Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Preparation
- [x] App rebranded to "BringAlong"
- [x] All environment variables templated
- [x] CORS configured for production
- [x] vercel.json created for frontend deployment
- [x] Dockerfile created for backend deployment
- [x] server/package.json created with production dependencies

### Repository Setup
- [ ] GitHub repository created
- [ ] Code pushed to main branch
- [ ] All sensitive files in .gitignore
- [ ] README.md updated with BringAlong information

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster created (recommended) OR Railway MongoDB
- [ ] Production environment variables prepared:
  - Backend: PORT, MONGODB_URI, NODE_ENV, FRONTEND_URL
  - Frontend: VITE_API_URL

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Backend Deployment (Railway)
- [ ] Railway account created
- [ ] Repository connected to Railway
- [ ] Environment variables set in Railway:
  - [ ] PORT=3001
  - [ ] MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection>
  - [ ] NODE_ENV=production
  - [ ] FRONTEND_URL=<will_set_after_frontend>
- [ ] Backend deployment successful
- [ ] Backend URL noted: ___________________

### Phase 2: Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
- [ ] Vercel account created and connected to GitHub
- [ ] Repository imported to Vercel
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel:
  - [ ] VITE_API_URL=<your_railway_backend_url>
- [ ] Frontend deployment successful
- [ ] Frontend URL noted: ___________________

### Phase 3: Final Configuration
- [ ] Update Railway FRONTEND_URL with Vercel URL
- [ ] Test frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Verify CORS is working correctly
- [ ] Test key features:
  - [ ] Trip posting
  - [ ] Trip searching
  - [ ] User authentication
  - [ ] LinkedIn integration

## Post-Deployment

### Verification
- [ ] All API endpoints working
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Mobile responsive design working
- [ ] Search functionality with "Near by" tags working
- [ ] Currency conversion working

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Custom domain setup (BringAlong.net)
- [ ] SSL certificate verification
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Analytics setup (e.g., Google Analytics)

## Troubleshooting Resources

### Common Issues
1. **CORS Errors**: Check FRONTEND_URL in Railway matches Vercel domain
2. **Database Connection**: Verify MONGODB_URI format and network access
3. **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version compatibility
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required vars are set
